<p>Skyrim, also known as the Old Kingdom, Throat of the World,[1] the Fatherland or Keizaal (Dragon Language: K.svgEi.svgZ.svgAa.svgL.svg Keiz-Aal, "Rebellion-May"[note 1]), is a vast region set in the northern part of Tamriel.[2] It is the home of the Nords, large and hardy men and women who have a strong resistance to frost, both natural and magical.[2][3] Skyrim was originally inhabited by a race of Mer known as the Snow Elves, though after the Nordic-Falmer War, the Snow Elves were mostly destroyed and the Atmorans settled the land.[4] It is bordered by Morrowind to the east, the Nibenay and Colovia in Cyrodiil to the south, Hammerfell to the southwest, and High Rock to the west. The island of Solstheim lies to the northeast of Skyrim, now a sovereign territory of Morrowind. </p>
